## I decided to create my profile on GitHub because I want to share my pieces of knowledge, and on another side, I am open to meeting new people that want to collaborate on any project. The focus is to learn about Deep learning applied to computer vision and machine learning techniques. I'll also use Python and R programs as the principal language in my project.   ðŸ‘‹
