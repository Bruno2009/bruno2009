## I decided to create my profile on GitHub because I want to share my pieces of knowledge. The focus is to learn about statistics Models based on log-likelihood function, Deep learning applied to computer vision, and machine learning techniques. I'll also use the Python and R programs as the principal language in my projecs. ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹
